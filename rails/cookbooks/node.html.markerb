If your application is based on Rails 5.2 through 6.1, or is a Rails 7 app
selecting one of the JavaScript options or many of the css options, you will
require Node.js to be included in your deployment image.

While it is unsurprising that the slim ruby image doesn't include Nodejs by
default, what is surprising is that the most obvious way of installing
node and yarn using the Debian packages included with the distribution
results in seriously outdated versions being installed.  Specifically,
nodejs version 12.22.12, and yarnpkg version 1.12.10.

Active support for node 12 ended in 2020, and security support
ended in 2022.

Attempting to run anyway ends up with an error running 'yarn build',
first because yarn is called yarnpkg, and second because the generated
`package.json` has no build step.

Fortunately, there are alternatives.

## Nodesource

We can start with the Node.js
[recommendation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions).


```dockerfile
<%= dockerfile 'docs/rails/cookbooks/node/Dockerfile1' do |patch|
  patch[/WORKDIR demo\nRUN yarn add.*\n+/] = ''
  patch[/RUN bin\/rails.*EOF/m] = [
    'COPY <<-"EOF" /demo/config/routes.rb',
    'Rails.application.routes.draw { root "rails/welcome#index" }',
    'EOF'
  ].join("\n")
end %>
```

Unfortunately this results in a rather chonky image, clocking in at 750MB.  And
attempting to reduce the size by installing packages such as `build-essentials`
later results in failures.

## merging images

Another approach is merge files from the official node and ruby images.

```dockerfile
<%= dockerfile 'docs/rails/cookbooks/node/Dockerfile2' do |patch|
  patch[/WORKDIR demo\nRUN yarn add.*\n+/] = ''
  patch[/RUN bin\/rails.*EOF/m] = [
    'COPY <<-"EOF" /demo/config/routes.rb',
    'Rails.application.routes.draw { root "rails/welcome#index" }',
    'EOF'
  ].join("\n")
end %>
```

The resulting images size is smaller at 465MB.  The danger here is that the node and
ruby images may not be based on the same image.  At the current time both are based
on Debian bullseye, but that may not always remain the case.  Both
[ruby](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby) and [node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node)
provide multiple alternates so it shouldn't be difficult to find a match.

## volta

A third approach is to use a version manager.  Much like how Ruby has rvm,
rbenv, chruby and others, Node has several.
[Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/) is one written in Rust that works well
for this task.

A minimal Dockerfile making use of Volta would look like the following:

```dockerfile
<%= dockerfile 'docs/rails/cookbooks/node/Dockerfile3' do |patch|
  patch[/WORKDIR demo\nRUN yarn add.*\n+/] = ''
  patch[/RUN bin\/rails.*EOF/m] = [
    'COPY <<-"EOF" /demo/config/routes.rb',
    'Rails.application.routes.draw { root "rails/welcome#index" }',
    'EOF'
  ].join("\n")
end %>
```

The resulting image is slightly larger at 499 MB.  The advantage of this approach
is that you don't have to worry about base images matching.

## Node as the base

A fourth option is to flip the script: start with node as the base and add ruby.
Debian bullseye includes Ruby 2.7 which ended support on March 31, 2023.

```dockerfile
<%= dockerfile 'docs/rails/cookbooks/node/Dockerfile4' do |patch|
  patch[/WORKDIR demo\nRUN yarn add.*\n+/] = ''
  patch[/RUN bin\/rails.*EOF/m] = [
    'COPY <<-"EOF" /demo/config/routes.rb',
    'Rails.application.routes.draw { root "rails/welcome#index" }',
    'EOF'
  ].join("\n")
end %>
```

Node the change to the second `COPY --from=gems` line as the location of the
gem directory has changed.

This results in the smallest image yet, at 424 MB.  The downside is that you
get a dated Ruby.

Variations are possible, including copying Ruby from the base docker image
or using a Ruby version manager such as
[rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install),
[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation), or
[chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby#install).

## Example application

Below is an example application that demonstrates React.js working with esbuild.

Start by adding the following lines immediately before the `FROM base` line:

```
WORKDIR demo
RUN yarn add react react-dom
```

Replace the three lines starting with
`COPY <<-"EOF" config/routes.rb` with the following:

```dockerfile
<%= dockerfile 'docs/rails/cookbooks/node/Dockerfile1' do |patch|
  patch[/RUN bin\/rails.*EOF/m]
end %>
```

Since this isn't a React or Rails tutorial, an overview of the contents will suffice:

  * A counter component which extracts attributes from the root element and
    displays a counter which increments every second.
  * A time controller and view which includes an SVG image and sets 
    HTML attributes containing the Ruby, Rails, and Node versions.

## Recap

There are multiple ways to build an image containing both Node.js and Ruby.
Finding the right one for your application requires a bit of trial and error
and personal preference.
